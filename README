=================

Basic usage
-----------
To run use the following commands:

./configure
make

If there are no errors, you can run the program using:

cd src 
./scene

N.B. The program MUST be run from the src directory since it uses relative paths

teddy.ply is expected to be in the src/ directory

Code structure
--------------
The code is structured in the following way:
- main.cpp 
  Initialises the OpenGL pipeline, renders the scene, etc.

- models.hpp/models.cpp
  Implementation of the models: teddy, parametric surface, floor and teapot  

- util.hpp/util.cpp
  Implementation of useful functions used throughout the application

- base.hpp
  Includes the required files
